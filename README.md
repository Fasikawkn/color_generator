# Color Generator App

## Functionality of the app
  - **Dynamic Color Transformation:** Through a simple tap on the screen, the background color transforms smoothly to a randomly generated color.
- **Adaptive Text Color:** To ensure readability and aesthetic coherence, the app's central text adapts intelligently between white and black based on the background color.
- **Color History and Application:** The app enables users to explore a curated history of previously generated colors. Additionally, users can select their preferred color from the history list and apply it as the new background with ease.
